# Admin App Documentation — Smart Pricing Playground

The Admin App is the main interface for marketers and product managers.  
It allows users to create pricing experiments, configure price variants, monitor performance, and view analytics generated by Thompson Sampling.

This page describes the structure, functionality, and user flow of the admin application.

---

## 1. Overview

The Admin App provides:

- Product management  
- Price variant configuration  
- Bandit (experiment) setup  
- Real-time analytics  
- Posterior distribution visualizations  
- Experiment summary dashboards  

The interface is implemented using **Streamlit**, backed by the Smart Pricing Playground API.

## 2. Main App Sections

The Admin UI is divided into the following pages:

1. **Dashboard / Home** — lists projects and experiments  
2. **Create Product** — upload product info and image  
3. **Define Price Variants** — configure bandit arms  
4. **Experiment View** — run pricing experiments  
5. **Analytics** — performance tables and charts  
6. **Posterior Visualization** — Thompson Sampling distributions  

---

## 3. Application Flow

### **Step 1 — Create a Product**
Users provide:
- Product name  
- Description  
- Optional image upload  

Once created, the product receives a `project_id`.

---

### **Step 2 — Add Price Variants**
Each price variant becomes a bandit arm.

A price variant includes:
- Price  
- Initial parameters (mean, variance or alpha, beta)  
- Label (optional)

The UI performs validation before sending data to the backend.

---

### **Step 3 — Launch the Experiment**
After prices are created, users can:

- View the current active experiment  
- Trigger price selection  
- Monitor incoming interactions  
- Reset or restart experiments  

The UI pulls updated bandit metrics every time data changes.

---

## 4. Visual Components

### **4.1 Product Card**
Displays:

- Image  
- Name  
- Description  
- Button to manage price variants  

### **4.2 Price Variant Table**
Shows real-time metrics:

| Price | Impressions | Conversions | Conversion Rate | Mean Reward |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|

Updated automatically via API calls.

---

### **4.3 Posterior Distribution Plot**

Graphs the probability density for each price.  
Shows how the algorithm updates beliefs based on live data.

Displayed using backend-generated image or Streamlit chart.

---

## 5. Integration with Thompson Sampling

The Admin App interacts with:

### **POST /projects/{id}/thompson/select**
Used to trigger the next price selection whenever an experiment runs.

### **GET /projects/{id}/posterior**
Used to update the graph after each iteration.

### **GET /projects/{id}/bandits/performance**
Used to populate analytics and summary tables.

---

## 6. Analytics Dashboard

The dashboard displays:

### **KPIs**
- Total impressions  
- Total conversions  
- Overall revenue  
- Estimated optimal price  

### **Charts**
- Conversion rate per price  
- Revenue distribution  
- Time-series experiment performance  
- Posterior distributions  

### **Tables**
- Aggregations used for evaluation (mean, variance, trials)  

---

## 7. Design Philosophy

The Admin App is designed to be:

- **Simple** for non-technical users  
- **Interpretable** through clear analytics  
- **Extensible** for new algorithms  
- **Modular** through well-separated API calls  

---

## 8. Summary

The Admin App is the control center for Smart Pricing Playground.  
It:

- Manages experiments  
- Displays real-time analytics  
- Visualizes Thompson Sampling learning  
- Enables intuitive, data-driven pricing decisions  

The app connects seamlessly to the backend and ETL pipeline, ensuring that experimentation is both accessible and scientifically grounded.
