## Project Overview

Our project focuses on developing a **dynamic pricing and product testing system** using **Thompson Sampling**, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm.  
The goal is to help businesses identify the optimal price point for a product **faster**, **more efficiently**, and **more adaptively** than traditional A/B testing.

This documentation covers:

- Problem Area & Motivation  
- Preliminary Research  
- Methodology  
- Data Collection & Algorithms  
- Expected Outcomes  
- Evaluation Metrics
